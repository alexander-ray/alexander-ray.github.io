I'm a software developer who enjoys the process of writing out problems, and in the process hopefully helping someone understand a concept or look at something from a new angle. At the time of writing there's no grand plan for this site; it's mostly a place to put some docs that I've written in conversations with friends, or things that have just been on my mind.

Feel free to get in touch, either through email or an issue on this repo.
